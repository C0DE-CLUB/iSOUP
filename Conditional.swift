let apartmentNumber = 101 // First, you created a constant, apartmentNumber, and assigned it to 101

if apartmentNumber >= 100 {  //The if statement for apartmentNumber tests if the apartmentNumber is greater than or equal to 100
  print("This apartment number can be found on the first floor...") // Because the constant is 101 the statement returns true and executes the print statement
  }
