You can compare one value to another using comparison operators

== //Equal to
!= //Not Equal To
> //Greater than
< // Less than\
>= //Greater than or equal to
<= //Less than or equal to

4 == 4 // returns true because 4 is equal to 4
3 != 1 // returns true because 3 is not equal to 1
7 > 2 // returns true because 7 is greater than 2
2 < 7 // returns true because 2 is less than 7 
3 >= 3 // returns true because 3 is greater than or equal to 3
7  <= 2 returns false because 7 is not less than or equal to 2
