"In math, order of operations are the rules that state the sequence in which the multiple operations in an expression should be solved."

+ // A plus sign is used to represent Addition
- // A hyphen is used to represent Subtraction
* // An asterisk is used to represent Multiplication
/ // A front slash is used to represent Division

let sum = 44 + 44 // The sum is 88
let result = 21 - sum // The result here is - 67
let total = result * 3 // The total here is - 201
let divide = total/7 // Note that divided by 7 returns -28 instead of -28.714, as both numbers are integers
