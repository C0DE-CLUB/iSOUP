![Order of Operations](https://i.imgur.com/3OXck6b.png)

_**A way to remember the order of operations is PEMDAS, where in each letter stands for a mathematical operation.**

1. _**Parentheses - They take precedence over all other operators. The first step is to solve all the operations within the parantheses. Work out all groupings from inside to out. (Whatever is in parentheses is a grouping)
2. _**Exponents - Work out all the exponential expressions.
3. _**Multiplication and Division - Next, moving from left to right, multiply and/ or divide whichever comes first.
4. _**Addition and Subtraction - Lastly, moving from left to right, add and/ or subtract whichever comes first.
